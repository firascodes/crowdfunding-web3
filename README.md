## Getting Started

Kickstart your project using this example:

```bash
npx thirdweb create --template vite-javascript-starter
```

You can start customizing the platform by modifying `src/main.jsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

In `src/index.jsx`, you'll find our `ThirdwebProvider` wrapping your app. This is crucial for our [hooks](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react) and [UI Components](https://portal.thirdweb.com/ui-components) to function properly.

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the necessary environment variables. Refer to the `.env.example` file for all required environment variables and add them to your `.env.local` file or set them up on your hosting provider.

### Deploy to IPFS

Deploy a version of your application to IPFS using the following command:

```bash
yarn deploy
```
